\title{Generate a nearest-neighbor network}
\usage{
networkNN(p, k = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Integer. The number of nodes in the network.}

\item{k}{Integer. The number of nearest neighbors each node is connected to.
Must satisfy \code{k < p}. Default is 5.}
}
\value{
A \code{p × p} symmetric matrix representing the weighted adjacency
structure (or precision-like matrix). Off-diagonal entries correspond to
edge weights, and diagonal entries are set to the sum of absolute weights of
each row plus 0.1 to ensure diagonal dominance.
}
\description{
This function generates a symmetric adjacency (precision-like) matrix for a
\code{p}-node network by placing nodes at random coordinates in a 2D plane and
connecting each node to its \code{k} nearest neighbors. Edge weights are drawn
uniformly from \code{[0.2, 0.4]}, and diagonal entries are set to enforce
strict diagonal dominance.
