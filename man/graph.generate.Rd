\title{Generate adjacency matrices under various network structures}
\usage{
graph.generate(p, graph = "hub", m = 1, neighb = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Integer. The dimension of the adjacency matrix; must be at least 2.}

\item{graph}{Character string specifying the type of network structure.
Available options include \code{"star"}, \code{"hub"}, \code{"banded"},
\code{"scale-free"}, \code{"Barabasi-Albert"}, \code{"small-world"},
\code{"Watts-Strogatz"}, \code{"random"}, and \code{"Erdos-Renyi"}.}

\item{m}{Integer. The number of blocks into which the \code{p} nodes are split
when constructing a block-structured network. Defaults to 1.}

\item{neighb}{Integer. The neighborhood size used when generating small-world
or Watts–Strogatz networks, or the number of off-diagonal bands to retain when
\code{graph = "banded"}. Must not exceed the block size.}
}
\value{
A \code{p × p} adjacency matrix representing the generated network
structure, with block-wise construction if \code{m > 1}.
